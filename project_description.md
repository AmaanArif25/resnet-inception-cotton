# 🌿 Cotton Leaf Disease Prediction - Project Description

This project uses **transfer learning** with advanced deep learning models like **ResNet50**, **InceptionV3**, and **ResNet152V2** to classify cotton leaf diseases.

## 🧠 Models Used

- 🔍 ResNet50
- 🔬 InceptionV3
- 🌐 ResNet152V2

## 🎯 Objective

To automate the detection of cotton leaf diseases using computer vision techniques and pretrained models, helping improve agricultural practices and yield.

## 📊 Dataset

The model was trained using a dataset of cotton plant leaves that are categorized as:
- Diseased
- Fresh/Healthy

## 📁 Notebooks

- `Transfer Learning Resnet 50.ipynb`
- `Transfer Learning Inception V3.ipynb`
- `Transfer Learning resnet152V2.ipynb`

Each notebook shows training, evaluation, and prediction steps.

## 🚀 Outcome

The project demonstrates how transfer learning can be applied to real-world agricultural problems, providing accurate disease detection from leaf images.
